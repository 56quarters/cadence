// This example shows how you might use the Cadence client in your multithreaded
// application by simply cloning a copy of it for each thread that needs to emit
// metrics. This is probably not as performant as using an Arc and doesn't offer
// the advantage of using the trait `MetricClient` instead of the concrete type
// but it's pretty simple.
