[Cadence Documentation](https://docs.rs/cadence/)

[Macros Documentation](https://docs.rs/cadence-macros/)

An extensible Statsd client for Rust!

Cadence is a fast and flexible way to emit Statsd metrics from your application.

## Features

* [Support](https://docs.rs/cadence/) for emitting counters, timers, histograms, distributions,
  gauges, meters, and sets to Statsd over UDP (or optionally Unix sockets).
* Support for alternate backends via the `MetricSink` trait.
* Support for [Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/dogstatsd/) style metrics tags and extensions.
* [Macros](https://docs.rs/cadence-macros/) to simplify common calls to emit metrics
* A simple yet flexible API for sending metrics.

## Usage

An example of how to use Cadence for maximum performance is given below. For many more examples
and advanced use cases, see the [`cadence`](cadence) crate or the [documentation](https://docs.rs/cadence/).

```rust
use std::net::UdpSocket;
use cadence::prelude::*;
use cadence::{StatsdClient, QueuingMetricSink, BufferedUdpMetricSink, DEFAULT_PORT};

let socket = UdpSocket::bind("0.0.0.0:0").unwrap();
socket.set_nonblocking(true).unwrap();

let host = ("metrics.example.com", DEFAULT_PORT);
let udp_sink = BufferedUdpMetricSink::from(host, socket).unwrap();
let queuing_sink = QueuingMetricSink::from(udp_sink);
let client = StatsdClient::from_sink("my.prefix", queuing_sink);

client.count("my.counter.thing", 29);
client.time("my.service.call", 214);
```

## Project layout

The [`cadence`](cadence) crate contains the Statsd client and primary API of Cadence. The
[`cadence-macros`](cadence-macros) crate contains optional  macros that can simplify use of
the Cadence API.

* [`cadence`](cadence): Statsd client and primary API
* [`cadence-macros`](cadence-macros): Optional convenience macros

additional terms or conditions.

## Language Support

Cadence (latest master) supports building with a range of `1.60+` versions.

### Guaranteed to Build

The latest version of Cadence is tested against and will always build
correctly with

* The current `stable` version.
* The previous two stable versions, `stable - 1` and `stable - 2`.

### Best Effort Build

The latest version of Cadence is tested against and will *usually* build
correctly with

* The next two oldest stable versions, `stable - 3` and `stable - 4`.

Support for these versions may be dropped for a release in order to take
advantage of a feature available in newer versions of Rust.

### Known to Work

* Stable versions as far back as `1.41` are known to work with Cadence
  `0.26.0` through `0.29.0`.

* Stable versions as far back as `1.36` are known to work with Cadence
  `0.21.0` through `0.25.0`. 

* Stable versions as far back as `1.34` are known to work with Cadence
  `0.20.0`.

* Stable versions as far back as `1.32` are known to work with Cadence
  `0.19.0`.
