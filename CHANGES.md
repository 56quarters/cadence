# Changelog

## [v0.29.1](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.29.1) - 2022-05-22
* Fix a bug where distribution metrics didn't include default tags per
  [#184](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/pull/184).
  Thanks to @danielsig727 for this contribution.

## [v0.29.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.29.0) - 2022-04-02
* Add support for "default tags" that can be added to a `StatsdClient` when creating
  it using the builder per [#172](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/pull/172).
  Default tags will be automatically added to all metrics emitted by the client.
  Thanks to @look for this contribution.

## [v0.28.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.28.0) - 2022-01-28
* **Breaking change** - Add support for [packed values](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/dogstatsd/datagram_shell/?tab=metrics#dogstatsd-protocol-v11)
  which allows multiple values to be sent as a single metric for histogram,
  distribution, and timer types per [#169](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/pull/169).
  The Cadence client now accepts `Vec<T>` for histogram, distribution, and timer
  methods. Note that this feature is a Datadog extension and so may not be supported
  by your server. It is supported by versions `>=v6.25.0 && <v7.0.0` or `>=v7.25.0`
  of the Datadog agent. Thanks to @Jason8Ni for this contribution.

## [v0.27.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.27.0) - 2021-12-26
* **Breaking change** - `StatsdClient` no longer implements the `Clone` trait
  due to now using `Box` internally instead of `Arc` per
  [#163](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/pull/163). Where `StatsdClient`
  was `.clone()`'d previously, it should now be wrapped with an `Arc` to enable
  it to be cloned.
* Minor performance improvement in the way metric tags are formatted per
  [#161](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/pull/161).

## [v0.26.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.26.0) - 2021-07-23
* **Breaking change** - Client traits are now generic across supported types of
  values [#132](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/132). This change
  should be source-compatible in most cases for users importing the Cadence
  `prelude` module. Type-specific deprecated methods have been moved to a new
  `Compat` trait to ease this migration. This trait and its implementation will
  be removed in a future release. See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) for more
  information.
* Add support for `f64` values for histogram and distribution metric types per
  [#131](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/131).
* Minimum supported Rust version for Cadence is now 1.41 per
  [#138](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/138).

## [v0.25.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.25.0) - 2021-03-21
* **Breaking change** - Added support for
  [DataDog distribution](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/metrics/types/?tab=distribution#definition)
  metric types per [#125](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/pull/125)
  thanks to @duarten.
* **Breaking change** - Rewrite `SpyMetricSink` and `BufferedSpyMetricSink`
  introduced in 0.22.0 to use channels for making written metrics available
  instead of shared `Write` implementation wrapped with a `Mutex`. The newly
  changed sinks now return a `crossbeam_channel::Receiver<Vec<u8>>` instance
  from their constructors that callers can use to read any metrics written by
  the sink. This avoids accidental cases of [mutex poisoning](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/poisoning.html)
  which can happen when the `Mutex` is held when an assertion fails as part of
  a test per [#124](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/124).

  Examples of how to use the newly rewritten sinks can be found in:
  * [cadence/examples/spy-sink.rs](cadence/examples/spy-sink.rs)
  * [cadence-macros/tests/lib.rs](cadence-macros/tests/lib.rs)
* **Breaking change** - Remove unsafe uses of `static mut` used for global state
  related to macros which caused undefined behavior per
  [#129](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/129) thanks to @parasyte.
  A consequence of  this that `cadence_macros::set_global_default` and
  `cadence_macros::get_global_default` now only accept instances of `StatsdClient`,
  not the trait `MetricClient`.

## [v0.24.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.24.0) - 2021-02-02

`cadence-macros` **yanked** due to causing undefined behavior [#129](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/129)

* Split the project into two crates. The `cadence` crate will continue to
  contain the primary client and API. The `cadence-macros` crate contains
  convenience macros for removing some boilerplate required to emit metrics
  per [#114](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/114).
* Fix `MultilineWriter` (used by buffered sinks) to honor the `Write::write`
  contract per [#117](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/117).

## [v0.23.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.23.0) - 2020-12-14
* **Breaking change** - Add method to emit `f64` types as gauges per
  [#106](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/106).
* Update `crossbeam-channel` dependency to `0.5` per
  [#110](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/pull/110).

## [v0.22.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.22.0) - 2020-10-08
* Add new `SpyMetricSink` and `BufferedSpyMetricSink` to allow inspecting
  metrics sent by Cadence as part of integration testing an application per
  [#103](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/103).

## [v0.21.1](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.21.1) - 2020-09-02
* Minor documentation improvements.

## [v0.21.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.21.0) - 2020-09-02
* Add a `.flush()` method to the `MetricSink` trait to allow applications to
  flush metrics out-of-band per [#100](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/100).

## [v0.20.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.20.0) - 2020-04-07
* The `QueuingMetricSink` can now be created with a fixed queue size using the
  `::with_capacity()` constructor. This allows users to limit the amount of
  memory used by sending metrics (in case the wrapped sink can't keep up with
  the rate of metrics being sent due to to some sort of error).
* Updated dependency on `crossbeam_channel` to version `0.4.0+`;
* **Breaking change** - The `Histogrammed` trait now includes methods for sending
  `Duration` objects, converted to nanoseconds, as histogram values.
* **Breaking change** - The `QueuingMetricSink::panics()` method now returns
  a `u64`, not a `usize`.

## [v0.19.1](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.19.1) - 2019-10-12
* Minor documentation improvements.

## [v0.19.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.19.0) - 2019-10-06
* Fix cases where sending large payloads (a single metric larger than a UDP
  packet while using the buffered UDP sink) caused an extra UDP packet to be
  sent containing only a newline per [#87](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/87).
* Add support for emitting metrics over a Unix socket via the new `UnixMetricSink`
  and `BufferedUnixMetricSink` per [#86](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/pull/86)
  thanks to Daniel Smith.
* Deprecate the `StatsdClient::from_udp_host` constructor which will be removed
  in a future release. Users are encouraged to use the `::from_sink()` and `::builder()`
  constructors instead.
* All Cadence examples (in the `examples` directory) are now available under
  the [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode.txt)
  agreement (basically public domain even in countries with no such concept).

## [v0.18.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.18.0) - 2019-07-31
* Allow empty strings to be use for metric prefixes. Previously, this would
  result in metrics with a leading `.`, now an empty prefix results in just
  the bare metric key.
* **Breaking change** - Update Cadence to build with Rust 2018 per
  [#82](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/82). Note that Cadence should
  still work fine with Rust 2015 code bases as well as Rust 2018 code bases. This
  is marked as a breaking change but will likely not require changes for most
  users. See the
  [Rust edition docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/index.html)
  for more information.

## [v0.17.1](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.17.1) - 2019-03-30
* Replace internal use of crossbeam `MsQueue` with channels from the
  `crossbeam_channel` crate per [#79](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/79).
  This change improves performance of the `QueuingMetricSink`, reducing
  the time taken to submit a metric by about 50%. This is a non-breaking
  change.

## [v0.16.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.16.0) - 2018-12-07
* **Breaking change** - Require that all sinks and error handlers used with
  `StatsdClient` are panic safe, that is, they implement `RefUnwindSafe` per
  [#77](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/77). Note that all sinks
  included with Cadence are panic safe so this shouldn't be much of a change
  for many users. See also [Rust #54768](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54768)
  for more information about the reasoning for the change.

## [v0.15.1](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.15.1) - 2018-07-19
* Update Cadence crate to forbid any uses of `unsafe {}` code.
* Minor documentation improvements.

## [v0.15.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.15.0) - 2018-07-12
* **Breaking change** - Add support for `Set` metric types. Sets can be used
  to count the number of unique occurences of an event. Per
  [#62](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/pull/72).
* Updated dependency on `crossbeam` to the latest version (0.3.2).

## [v0.14.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.14.0) - 2018-04-11
* **Breaking change** - Rename the `MetricBuilder::send()` method to
  `MetricBuilder::try_send()` and create a new `.send()` method that discards
  successful results and invokes a custom handler for error results. Handlers
  can be set by using a builder via the `StatsdClient::builder()` method.
  Per [#65](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/65).

## [v0.13.2](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.13.2) - 2018-03-13
* Warn when `MetricBuilder` instances aren't used when adding tags to metrics
  per [#63](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/63).

## [v0.13.1](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.13.1) - 2018-02-07
* Minor documentation improvements.

## [v0.13.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.13.0) - 2018-02-06
* **Breaking change** - Added `_with_tags` method variants to all traits for
  emitting metrics (`Counted`, `Timed`, `Gauged`, `Metered`, `Histogrammed`)
  per [#41](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/41). These methods will
  return a `MetricBuilder` instance that can be used to add
  [Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/dogstatsd/) style tags to
  metrics. Tags are an extension so they may not be supported by all Statsd
  servers.
* The `Metric` trait (which is used by each type of metric object for returning
  a `&str` representation of itself) is now part of the public API.

## [v0.12.2](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.12.2) - 2017-11-29
* Fix off-by-one bug in underlying functionality for `BufferedUdpSink`
  that would have caused extra writes to the UDP socket per
  [#59](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/59).

## [v0.12.1](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.12.1) - 2017-09-21
* Minor documentation improvements and code cleanup.

## [v0.12.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.12.0) - 2017-02-09
* Add new `time_duration` method to `Timed` trait per
  [#48](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/48). This allows users to record
  timings using the `Duration` struct from the standard library.
* Add examples of Cadence usage per [#36](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/36).

## [v0.11.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.11.0) - 2017-01-18
* **Breaking change** - Remove deprecated `AsyncMetricSink` per
  [#47](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/47). Users are encouraged to
  switch to `QueuingMetricSink` instead. `QueuingMetricSink` has similar performance,
  emits metrics asynchronously in another thread, and has a more ergonomic signature
  (not requiring a generic parameter for the wrapped sink).
* **Breaking change** - Remove the generic parameter `T` from the `StatsdClient` per
  [#45](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/45). Instead of requiring all users
  of the client to care about the `MetricSink` implementation, put it behind an `Arc`
  pointer in the client and remove the type `T` from the signature. This makes the
  client easier to use and share between threads.
* Remove use of `Arc` inside various sinks per [#35](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/35).

## [v0.10.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.10.0) - 2017-01-08
* **Breaking change** - Remove deprecated `ConsoleMetricSink` and `LoggingMetricSink`
  per [#46](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/46). Users wishing to still use
  these sinks are encouraged to
  [copy the code](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/blob/0.9.1/src/sinks/mod.rs)
  into their own projects or use Cadence version 0.9.1 until they migrate away from them.
* Deprecate `AsyncMetricSink` per [#34](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/34).
  Anyone still using `AsyncMetricSink` is encouraged to switch to `QueuingMetricSink`
  instead. Performance should be comparable but `QueuingMetricSink` can be shared
  between threads without requiring a `.clone()`.

## [v0.9.1](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.9.1) - 2017-01-01
* Change deprecation version of `LoggingMetricSink` and `ConsoleMetricSink` to 0.10.0.

## [v0.9.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.9.0) - 2017-01-01
* Implement `QueuingMetricSink` utilizing a lock-free queue from the Crossbeam
  library per [#30](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/30).
* Add new metric type, histograms, per [#40](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/40).
* Deprecate `LoggingMetricSink` per [#32](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/32).
* Deprecate `ConsoleMetricSink` per [#33](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/33).

## [v0.8.2](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.8.2) - 2016-12-12
* Internal code cleanup per [#29](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/29).

## [v0.8.1](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.8.1) - 2016-10-11
* Minor documentation fixes.

## [v0.8.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.8.0) - 2016-08-27
* Add new `BufferedUdpMetricSink` implementation of a `MetricSink` that
  buffers multiple metrics before sending then in a single network operation
  per [#18](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/18).
* Add new `AsyncMetricSink` implementation of a `MetricSink` that wraps
  another sink and sends metrics asynchronously using a thread pool per
  [#23](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/23).
* Implement `Clone` trait for all builtin sinks for easier use with multiple
  threads, specifically the `AsyncMetricSink` per
  [#24](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/24).

## [v0.7.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.7.0) - 2016-07-27
* Add new `MetricClient` trait implemented by `StatsdClient` that encompasses
  all of the other traits for emitting metrics (`Counted`, `Timed`, `Gauged`,
  and `Metered`) so that users can refer to a single type when used with
  generics or behind a pointer per [#20](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/20).

## [v0.6.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.6.0) - 2016-07-20
* Change Cadence to be dual licensed under Apache and MIT licenses per
  [#12](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/12).
* Improve documentation around `MetricSink` trait per
  [#13](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/13).
* **Behavior change** - Change UDP sockets created by
  `StatsdClient::from_udp_host` to be created in non-blocking mode by default
  per [#14](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/14). While this does
  change previous behavior, users of the library shouldn't notice much of
  a change. In instances where the caller would have blocked before, they
  will get a `MetricError` wrapping an `io::Error` (with an `ErrorKind` of
  `WouldBlock`). Users wishing to restore the old behavior can do so by
  creating a custom instance of `UdpMetricSink`. Thanks to the
  [Tikv](https://github.com/pingcap/tikv) team for the inspiration.

## [v0.5.2](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.5.2) - 2016-07-02
* Increase test coverage per [#10](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/10).
* Add documentation for setting up a UDP socket in non-blocking mode per
  [#8](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/8).

## [v0.5.1](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.5.1) - 2016-06-07
* Remove `debug!` call in internal StatsdClient call to cut down on log
  noise per [#7](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/pull/7).

## [v0.5.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.5.0) - 2016-03-10
* **Breaking change** - Rename the constructor of `UdpMetricSink` from `new`
  to `from` to better match Rust naming conventions for conversion constructors.

## [v0.4.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.4.0) - 2016-02-18
* Change name of method for getting metric `&str` representation. The old name
  implied that the instance was consumed which it was not.
* Create `cadence::prelude` module for easy import of `Counted`, `Timed`,
  `Gauged`, and `Metered` traits via a glob import. Fixes
  [#4](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/4).

## [v0.3.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.3.0) - 2016-02-07
* Change `LoggingMetricSink` log target to `cadence::metrics`.
* Minor documentation improvements. Fixes [#1](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/1).
* Add benchmarks to test suite.
* Reduce heap allocations when emitting metrics. Fixes
  [#3](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/issues/3).

## [v0.2.1](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.2.1) - 2015-12-27
* Change Cadence from MIT license to Apache-2.0 for better compatibility with
  BSD and GPLv3 licensed code.

## [v0.2.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.2.0) - 2015-12-26
* Remove unused development dependency.
* Add `Hash` trait to assorted metric types (`Counter`, `Timer`, `Gauge`, `Meter`).
* Documentation improvements.


## [v0.1.0](https://github.com/56quarters/cadence/tree/0.1.0) - 2015-12-22

* Initial release.
